## A graphical interface is of no use
	- X.org or any other graphics server
> by showing a terminal is first show up when just get logged in you can address about this 

## 'Debian' or 'Rocky'
	- In case of 'Rocky', don't have to set up 'KDump'
	but 'SELinux' must be running at startup
	- In case of 'Debian', 'AppArmor' must be running at startup
> printf list services that is running on this linux

## At least 2 encrypted partitions using 'LVM'

## Differences between 'aptitude' and 'apt'

## A 'SSH' service will be running on 'port 4242' only
	- It must not be possible to connect using 'SSH' as 'root'

## You have to configure your operating system with the 'UFW' and it will allow only 'port 4242'
	- In case of 'Rocky', use 'firewalld'

## The 'hostname' of your virtual machine must be your login ending with 42
	- You must be aware of how to change 'hostname'

## You have to implement a [strong password policy]

## You have to install and configure 'sudo' following strict rules

## In addition to the 'root' user, a user with your login as username has to be present (?)

## This user has to [belong to the 'user42' and 'sudo' groups]
	- You will have to create a new user and assign it to a group

## To set up a [strong password policy], you have to comply with the following requirements
	- Your password has to [expire every 30 days]
	- The [minimum number of days] allowed before the modification of a password will be set to '2'
	- The user has to [receive a warning message '7' days] before their [password expires]
	- Your password must be [at least 10 characters] long
	it must contain [an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number]
	also, it [must not contain more than 3 consecutive identical characters]
	- The password [must not include the name of the user]
	- The following rule [does not apply to the root password],
	the password [must have at least 7 characters that are not part of the former password]
	- Of course, your ['root' password has to comply with this policy]

## After setting up your configuration files,
you will [have to change all the passwords of the accounts] present on the virtual machine,
including the root account

## To set up a [strong configuration for your 'sudo' group], you have to comply with the following requirements
	- [Authentication using 'sudo' has to be limited to '3' attempts] in the event of an incorrect password
	- [A custom message] of your choice [has to be displayed if an error]
	due to a wrong password occurs [when using 'sudo']
	- [Each action using 'sudo' has to be archived], [both inputs and outputs]
	[the log file has to be saved in the '/var/log/sudo/' folder]
	- [The 'TTY' mode has to be enabled] for security reasons
	- For security reasons too, [the paths that can be used by 'sudo' must be restricted]
	example: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin

## You have to create a simple script called 'monitoring.sh' It must be developed in bash
[At server startup], [the script will display] some information [on all terminals every 10 minutes]
[The banner is optional] [No error must be visible]
	- The [architecture] of your operating system and its [kernel version]
	- The number of [physical processors]
	- The number of [virtual processors]
	- The current [available RAM] on your server and its [utilization rate] as a percentage
	- The current [available memory] on your server and its [utilization rate] as a percentage
	- The current [utilization rate of your processors] as a percentage
	- The [date and time of the last reboot]
	- Whether ['LVM' is active or not]
	- The number of [active connections]
	- The number of [users using the server]
	- The [IPv4 address] of your server and its [MAC (Media Access Control) address]
	- The number of [commands executed with the 'sudo'] program
	- You will also have to [interrupt it without modifying it] [Take a look at 'cron']

## [Set up partitions] correctly so you get a structure similar to the one below
	- [Set up a functional 'WordPress' website with the following services: 'lighttpd', 'MariaDB', 'PHP']
	- [Set up a service of your choice] that you think is useful ('NGINX' / 'Apache2' excluded!)
	during the defense, you will have to justify your choice
	- To complete the bonus part, you have the possibility to set up extra services
	in this case, [you may open more ports] to suit your needs
	of course, [the 'UFW'/'Firewalld' rules has to be adapted accordingly]
